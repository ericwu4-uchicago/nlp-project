      "To the People of the State of New York:\n",
      "WHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon\n",
      " to decide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of\n",
      " the most important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety\n",
      " of their taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious,\n",
      " view of it, will be evident.\n",
      "Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of\n",
      " government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however\n",
      " it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural\n",
      " rights in order to vest it with requisite powers. It is well worthy\n",
      " of consideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the\n",
      " interest of the people of America that they should, to all general\n",
      " purposes, be one nation, under one federal government, or that they\n",
      " should divide themselves into separate confederacies, and give to\n",
      " the head of each the same kind of powers which they are advised to\n",
      " place in one national government.\n",
      "It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion\n",
      " that the prosperity of the people of America depended on their\n",
      " continuing firmly united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of\n",
      " our best and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that\n",
      " object. But politicians now appear, who insist that this opinion is\n",
      " erroneous, and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in\n",
      " union, we ought to seek it in a division of the States into distinct\n",
      " confederacies or sovereignties. However extraordinary this new\n",
      " doctrine may appear, it nevertheless has its advocates; and certain\n",
      " characters who were much opposed to it formerly, are at present of\n",
      " the number. Whatever may be the arguments or inducements which have\n",
      " wrought this change in the sentiments and declarations of these\n",
      " gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the people at large to\n",
      " adopt these new political tenets without being fully convinced that\n",
      " they are founded in truth and sound policy.\n",
      "It has often given me pleasure to observe that independent\n",
      " America was not composed of detached and distant territories, but\n",
      " that one connected, fertile, widespreading country was the portion\n",
      " of our western sons of liberty. Providence has in a particular\n",
      " manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions, and\n",
      " watered it with innumerable streams, for the delight and\n",
      " accommodation of its inhabitants. A succession of navigable waters\n",
      " forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together;\n",
      " while the most noble rivers in the world, running at convenient\n",
      " distances, present them with highways for the easy communication of\n",
      " friendly aids, and the mutual transportation and exchange of their\n",
      " various commodities.\n",
      "With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence\n",
      " has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united\n",
      " people--a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same\n",
      " language, professing the same religion, attached to the same\n",
      " principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs,\n",
      " and who, by their joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side\n",
      " by side throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly established\n",
      " general liberty and independence.\n",
      "This country and this people seem to have been made for each\n",
      " other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an\n",
      " inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united\n",
      " to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a\n",
      " number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.\n",
      "Similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and\n",
      " denominations of men among us. To all general purposes we have\n",
      " uniformly been one people each individual citizen everywhere\n",
      " enjoying the same national rights, privileges, and protection. As a\n",
      " nation we have made peace and war; as a nation we have vanquished\n",
      " our common enemies; as a nation we have formed alliances, and made\n",
      " treaties, and entered into various compacts and conventions with\n",
      " foreign states.\n",
      "A strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the\n",
      " people, at a very early period, to institute a federal government to\n",
      " preserve and perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they\n",
      " had a political existence; nay, at a time when their habitations\n",
      " were in flames, when many of their citizens were bleeding, and when\n",
      " the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those\n",
      " calm and mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede\n",
      " the formation of a wise and wellbalanced government for a free\n",
      " people. It is not to be wondered at, that a government instituted\n",
      " in times so inauspicious, should on experiment be found greatly\n",
      " deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer.\n",
      "This intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects.\n",
      " Still continuing no less attached to union than enamored of\n",
      " liberty, they observed the danger which immediately threatened the\n",
      " former and more remotely the latter; and being pursuaded that ample\n",
      " security for both could only be found in a national government more\n",
      " wisely framed, they as with one voice, convened the late convention\n",
      " at Philadelphia, to take that important subject under consideration.\n",
      "This convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of\n",
      " the people, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by\n",
      " their patriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds\n",
      " and hearts of men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season\n",
      " of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many\n",
      " months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally,\n",
      " without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions\n",
      " except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the\n",
      " people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.\n",
      "Admit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only RECOMMENDED,\n",
      " not imposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended\n",
      " to BLIND approbation, nor to BLIND reprobation; but to that sedate\n",
      " and candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the\n",
      " subject demand, and which it certainly ought to receive. But this\n",
      " (as was remarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to\n",
      " be wished than expected, that it may be so considered and examined.\n",
      " Experience on a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine\n",
      " in such hopes. It is not yet forgotten that well-grounded\n",
      " apprehensions of imminent danger induced the people of America to\n",
      " form the memorable Congress of 1774. That body recommended certain\n",
      " measures to their constituents, and the event proved their wisdom;\n",
      " yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the press began to teem\n",
      " with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very measures. Not\n",
      " only many of the officers of government, who obeyed the dictates of\n",
      " personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of\n",
      " consequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose\n",
      " ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public\n",
      " good, were indefatigable in their efforts to pursuade the people to\n",
      " reject the advice of that patriotic Congress. Many, indeed, were\n",
      " deceived and deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned\n",
      " and decided judiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they\n",
      " did so.\n",
      "They considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and\n",
      " experienced men. That, being convened from different parts of the\n",
      " country, they brought with them and communicated to each other a\n",
      " variety of useful information. That, in the course of the time they\n",
      " passed together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests\n",
      " of their country, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on\n",
      " that head. That they were individually interested in the public\n",
      " liberty and prosperity, and therefore that it was not less their\n",
      " inclination than their duty to recommend only such measures as,\n",
      " after the most mature deliberation, they really thought prudent and\n",
      " advisable.\n",
      "These and similar considerations then induced the people to rely\n",
      " greatly on the judgment and integrity of the Congress; and they\n",
      " took their advice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors\n",
      " used to deter them from it. But if the people at large had reason\n",
      " to confide in the men of that Congress, few of whom had been fully\n",
      " tried or generally known, still greater reason have they now to\n",
      " respect the judgment and advice of the convention, for it is well\n",
      " known that some of the most distinguished members of that Congress,\n",
      " who have been since tried and justly approved for patriotism and\n",
      " abilities, and who have grown old in acquiring political\n",
      " information, were also members of this convention, and carried into\n",
      " it their accumulated knowledge and experience.\n",
      "It is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every\n",
      " succeeding Congress, as well as the late convention, have invariably\n",
      " joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of America\n",
      " depended on its Union. To preserve and perpetuate it was the great\n",
      " object of the people in forming that convention, and it is also the\n",
      " great object of the plan which the convention has advised them to\n",
      " adopt. With what propriety, therefore, or for what good purposes,\n",
      " are attempts at this particular period made by some men to\n",
      " depreciate the importance of the Union? Or why is it suggested that\n",
      " three or four confederacies would be better than one? I am\n",
      " persuaded in my own mind that the people have always thought right\n",
      " on this subject, and that their universal and uniform attachment to\n",
      " the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons, which I\n",
      " shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers. They\n",
      " who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct\n",
      " confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem\n",
      " clearly to foresee that the rejection of it would put the\n",
      " continuance of the Union in the utmost jeopardy. That certainly\n",
      " would be the case, and I sincerely wish that it may be as clearly\n",
      " foreseen by every good citizen, that whenever the dissolution of the\n",
      " Union arrives, America will have reason to exclaim, in the words of\n",
